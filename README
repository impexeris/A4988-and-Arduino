cntrSpeedDirDRV8825TimerPWM by impexeris
This file was frorked from cntrSpeedDir.ino, which was originally created by lucadentella 
It is adjusted for the DRV8825 motor driver chip. In fact for the Pololu DRV8825 board (adjustmets are simple - just added control for M0, M1 and M2.
This file would get backwards compatible with A4988  by commenting out lines 42,43,44,77,78,79,83,84,85, -
pins of the DRV8825 driver which alow to define microstepping mode on that particular board. In this particular case (1/32 microstepping for most smooth operation)
another cardinal change is use of the Timer1 PWM output on Arduino pin9 instead of interrupt driven pulsing. Rationale for this decission is that for the
simple constant driving of the motor PWM signal can be used from the Timer1, which is completely unblocking the micro-controller.

Other files are just the original files from the original creator lucadentella:

Arduino sketches:

- singleSteps.ino = control step by step
- cntrSpeedDir.ino = control speed and direction with continuous rotation
